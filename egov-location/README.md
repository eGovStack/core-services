### Swagger API Contract

Please refer to the [Swagger API contarct](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/egovernments/egov-services/master/docs/egov-location/contracts/v11-0-0.yml#!/) for egov-location service to understand the structure of APIs and to have visualization of all internal APIs.


## Service Details

The eGov location information also known as boundary date of ULBâ€™s are defined in  different hierarchies ADMIN/ELECTION hierarchy which is defined by theAdministrators, Revenue hierarchy defined by the Revenue department.

The election hierarchy has the locations divided into several types like zone, election ward, block, street  and locality. The Revenue hierarchy has the locations divided into zone, ward, block and locality.

The model which defines the localities like zone, ward and etc is boundary object which contains information like name, lat, long, parent or children boundary if any. The boundaries come under each other in hierarchy like zone contains wards, ward contains blocks, block contains locality. The order in which the boundaries are contained in each other will differ based on the tenants.
### Sample Config

The boundary data has been moved to mdms from the master tables in DB. The location service fetches the JSON from mdms and parses it to the structure of boundary object as mentioned above.. A sample master would look like below

```json
{
  "tenantId": "pg.cityA",
   "moduleName": "egov-location",
  "TenantBoundary": [
  {
      "hierarchyType": {
              "code": "ADMIN",
              "name": "ADMIN"
      },
       "boundary": {
                "id": 1,
                "boundaryNum": 1,
                "name": "CityA",
                "localname": "CityA",
                "longitude": null,
                "latitude": null,
                "label": "City",
                "code": "pg.cityA",
                "children": []
        }
  
    }
 ]
}
```
