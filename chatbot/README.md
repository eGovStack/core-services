### Service Dependencies

- `egov-user-chatbot` : For creating user without name validation and logging in user
- `egov-user` : For searching user
- `egov-localization` : The chatbot is made such that it will store localization codes and the actual text value will be fetched only at the end. This way we can provide multi-lingual support. Localization service is also used to construct messages from templates. This dependency can be eliminated if you want to pass values instead of localization codes.
- `egov-filestore` : It is a dependency if you want to send/receive any file. This includes sending PDF/Image files.
- `egov-url-shortening` : For shortening links sent to the user
- `egov-mdms-service` : For loading mdms data
- `egov-location` : For loading locality data
- `rainmaker-pgr` : For creating/searching PGR complaints

       recipient: /extraInfo/recipient

   matchAnswerThreshold: 70

   errorMessage: chatbot.messages.pgrCreateLocalityError
   ```

- Graph adjacency list configuration:- to define flow between chatbot states,ex:-

      root,pgr.create.tenantId,pgr.track.end
      pgr.create.tenantId,pgr.create.locality
      pgr.create.locality,pgr.create.landmark
